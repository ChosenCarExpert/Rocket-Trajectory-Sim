# Rocket-Trajectory-Sim
This project is a Python-based physics simulator that models rocket flight.   It uses fundamental physics equations  to show how a rocketâ€™s altitude changes over time.    The simulation is visualized with `matplotlib` and can be scaled from  a simple small classroom model rocket to a Falcon 9 booster.
